### Macro Economic Overview

- **Inflation**: Inflation numbers have stabilised and core inflation readings are consistently cooled, suggesting Fed's rate hike 2022-2023 have achieved their desired effect. Last month Fed also implementing slowing down quantitative tightening (QT) which mean they do not want the money supply to get reduced too fast - and by extension an attempt at controlling deflation instead of inflation. 
- **Tariffs impact lag**: The tariffs caused a lot of companies to stock up, the impact have not yet have a full cycle to inflation data but are adding to supply side pressures. Part of Trump plan is to make american exports competitive and he cannot do that without purposely devaluing the USD. 
- **Recession**: The US GDP in the first quarter contracted by 0.3%.  I expect Q2 2025 GDP data to confirm a 2nd consecutive quarter of negative growth - which is the economist's definition of a recession. While noone has been saying the R word for now, i expect news and media to overblow and overuse it once GDP data for Q2 are out, which would fuel a panic and add to more uncertainty. 
- **Labor market layoffs**: while job numbers are now starting to reflect layoffs, everyone knows and have noticed that since beginning of this year there have been more and more layoffs.


### Federal Reserve Outlook
Fed now has inflation under control and have acknowledge that a recession is very likely. So they have a room for operation in cutting interest rates and they will do such as late as possible and in typical fashion - after the fact i.e once everyone starts to panic sell. It might be as soon as next month for next quarter or later this year. But one thing is for sure imo, they are not gonna increase interest rates.
